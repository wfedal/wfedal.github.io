I had a very good seat. The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could not hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round again. ‘I can’t hear a word!’ I said angrily. ‘It’s none of your business, ‘ the young man said rudely. ‘This is a private conversation!’ When $a \\ne 0$, there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are$$x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}.$$","link":"/2023/11/19/Mathematics/"}],"tags":[],"categories":[]}
